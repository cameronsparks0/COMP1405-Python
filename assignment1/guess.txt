import the random module
set target to a number between 0 and 65535 using the randint function
set flag to 0
while flag is 0
    ask the user to input an integer between 0 and 65535 and store it in a variable called guess.
    check if guess is lower then target if it is
        print to the terminal that the guess is lower then the target
    check if guess is higher then target if it is
        print to the terminal that the guess is higher then the target
    check if guess is = to target if it is
        print to the terminal that the user has guessed the correct answer
        set flag to 1
    The program will repeat from line 4 until the user has guessed the answer and the flag is set to 1 breaking the loop
exit the program
